This public domain book reader is a web app project completed as part of the Mobile Systems Programming course at Krak√≥w University of Economics. The goal was to apply knowledge of mobile development principles and web technologies to create a functional and user-friendly reading experience. This project serves as a practical example of how mobile systems can be used to provide access to literature.
